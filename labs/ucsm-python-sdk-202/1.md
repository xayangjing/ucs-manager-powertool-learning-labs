# Intermediate UCS Python SDK Part II Cisco DevNet Learning Labs

## Overview
UCS Python SDK is a set of Python modules, each containing one or more classes, developed specifically to automate UCS Manager. UCS Python SDK is developed with PEP8 compliance and supports every Managed Object exposed by the UCS XML Object Model . A special function convert_to_ucs_python() enables automatic Python script generation from operations performed in the UCS Manager GUI. Use convert_to_ucs_python() to quickly script UCS tasks.

Cisco UCS is an Integrated Compute Infrastructure that has supported an XML API since its introduction. UCS Manager is the service that provides the XML API endpoint along with a graphical interface and a command line.  The UCS components both physical and logical are represented as XML objects in a hierarchical Object Model format and can be manipulated via the XML API.

All UCS objects are described in an XML schema, this schema defines the objects their attributes and associated values. The schema is also used to generate a significant amount of the UCS Manager Python SDK. Because a UCS component must be part of the Object Model to be part of the UCS system all components of UCS are always available via the XML API.

## Objective
This Intermediate UCS Python Learning Lab will guide you through the use of UCS Python SDK to connect to a UCS Manager, add/set several UCS Manager settings, export UCS Manager configurations (backup), create one-time backup jobs and import a backup export.

Completion time: 30 minutes

## Prerequisites
Prior to starting this learning lab it would be helpful to understand UCS Manager and the functionality that it provides to manage UCS compute environments.

An understanding of Python would also be helpful.

## UCS Python SDK
UCS Python SDK is a library of python code that enables the retrieval and manipulation of UCS Manager managed objects. UCS Manager API interaction can be categorized into several distinct sections.
* Sessions
* Methods
* Queries and Filters
* Configurations and Transactions
* Event Subscription

UCS Python SDK provides modules, classes and functions for all the categorizations of UCS Manager API interactions, along with functions that allow for the inspection of object metadata and object hierarchical containment.

## UCS Python SDK Download and Documentation
UCS Python SDK is a community supported project, the code, documentation and samples repositories are on [github.com](https://github.com/CiscoUcs/ucsmsdk).


### Event Infrastructure Utilization

  If you are utilizing event provided infrastructure a script has been provided to reset the environment to pre-lab settings.

  On the desktop <strong>*Double-click*</strong> the `Reset-Ucs-LL` shortcut, provide the UCS Manager IP address that was assigned to you for the Learning Lab and hit <strong>*Enter*</strong>

  Repeat this process for each assigned IP address, if you were assigned more than one.
