# Introduction to UCS PowerTool Part I Cisco DevNet Learning Labs

### Exercise 2
Launch UCS PowerTool, connect to a UCS Manager, query for various UCS objects and manipulate the output. Then disconnect from the UCS Manager.

  1. Connect to the UCS Manager

  `Connect-Ucs -Name <ip-address-ucs-manager>`

  User: admin

  Password: password

  2. Query for the UCS compute resources. UCS Manager supports several different types of UCS compute resources, blades, cartridges and rack mounts. First use the `Get-UcsBlade` cmdlet to see what blades are in the system. At the prompt type

  `Get-UcsBlade`

  Get-UcsBlade:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-06.jpg)<br/><br/>

  There is a lot of output from this cmdlet, but perhaps we are only interested in seeing the Dn of the compute resource.

  3. To retrieve just the Dn of the compute resource, at the prompt type

  `Get-UcsBlade | Select-Object Dn`

  Get-UcsBlade | Select-Object Dn:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-07.jpg)<br/><br/>

  The Dn has been retrieved, but what exactly is a Dn? A Dn is the Distinguished Name of the UCS Object.  Every object in the UCS has a Dn, it is an unambiguous reference to the object in the entire UCS Object Model.

  UCS objects along with having a Dn that uniquely identifies them also belong to a particular Object Class. The Class type for a UCS Blade is `computeBlade`

  There are other types of compute resources supported by UCS Manager, in addition to blades there are cartridges (the UCS M-Series servers) and rack mounts (the UCS C-Series servers)

  The UCS Object Class for a rack mount server is `computeRackUnit`, the class for a cartridge server is `computeServerUnit`

  To view the C-Series and M-Series servers utilize the `Get-UcsRackUnit` and `Get-UcsServerUnit` cmdlets respectively.

  4. To retrieve the Dns of the rack and cartridge servers, at the prompt type

  `Get-UcsRackUnit | Select-Object Dn`

  `Get-UcsServerUnit | Select-Object Dn`

  Get-UcsRackUnit & Get-UcsServerUnit:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-08.jpg)<br/><br/>

  5. In UCS Manager there are concrete objects and abstract objects. Concrete objects can be standalone or have inherited attributes from abstract objects. In the case of the UCS compute resources the final class objects inherit from an abstract class called `computePhysical`. This class allows for a cmdlet called `Get-UcsServer` to retrieve all the compute resources in a UCS system.

  To retrieve Dns for all the compute resources in a UCS system, at the command prompt type

  `Get-UcsServer | Select-Object Dn`

  Get-UcsServer:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-09.jpg)<br/><br/>

  6. Every UCS object has attributes, so far with the compute objects we have only retrieved the Dn attribute. We have also run the PowerTool cmdlets without any parameters. The cmdlets support many parameters related to the UCS object as well as the [Microsoft PowerShell Common Parameters](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847884.aspx)

  To retrieve a UCS compute resource by its Dn specify the Dn as a parameter to the cmdlet specific to the compute resource type.

  Try each compute resource cmdlet specifying the Dn as shown in each example, at the command prompt type

  `Get-UcsBlade -Dn sys/chassis-1/blade-1`

  `Get-UcsRackUnit -Dn sys/rack-unit-1`

  `Get-UcsServerUnit -Dn  sys/chassis-2/cartridge-1/server-2`

  Get-UcsBlade with a Dn:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-10.jpg)<br/><br/>

  7. As you can see there are many attributes associated with the compute resource objects. Not all are represented by parameters in the cmdlets. To see what parameters the cmdlets support run the PowerShell cmdlet `Get-Help` with the PowerTool cmdlet as the input to `Get-Help`

  To get help for `Get-UcsRackUnit`, at the command prompt type

  `Get-Help -Name Get-UcsRackUnit`

  Get-Help -Name Get-UcsRackUnit:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-11.jpg)<br/><br/>

  Try the other three compute resource cmdlets as well

  `Get-Help -Name Get-UcsBlade`

  `Get-Help -Name Get-UcsServerUnit`

  `Get-Help Get-UcsServer`

  That's not a typo the `-Name` parameter is not required.

  Hopefully you noticed that there are different parameters for different compute resource types. As well as there being different parameters there are sometimes multiple ways to call a cmdlet.  The way a cmdlet is called depends on the *default pipeline object* or the *specified object*. Pipeline objects will be explored more in a later lab as will the direct specification of an object.

  You can even try `Get-Help Get-Help` or just `Get-Help`.

  8. Disconnect from UCS Manager, at the command prompt type

  `Disconnect-Ucs`

This is the end of exercise 2.
