# Introduction to UCS PowerTool Part I Cisco DevNet Learning Labs

## Overview
UCS PowerTool is a library of PowerShell Cmdlets that enable the management of UCS environments from Microsoft Operating Systems, via the UCS XML API.

Cisco UCS is an Integrated Compute Infrastructure that has supported an XML API since its introduction. UCS Manager is the service that provides the XML API endpoint along with a graphical interface and a command line.  The UCS components both physical and logical are represented as XML objects in a hierarchical Object Model format and can be manipulated via the XML API.

All UCS objects are described in an XML schema, this schema defines the objects their attributes and associated values. The schema is also used to generate more than 98% of the UCS PowerTool Library. Because a UCS component must be part of the Object Model to be part of the UCS system all components of UCS are always available via the XML API.

## Objective
This Introduction to UCS PowerTool Learning Lab will guide you through the use of UCS PowerTool to connect to a UCS Manager, perform queries against UCS Manager objects and disconnect from the UCS Manager. UCS Manager Objects are representations of pools, policies, other logical constructs and physical entities.

Completion time: 30 minutes

## Prerequisites
Prior to starting this learning lab it would be helpful to understand UCS Manager and the functionality that it provides to manage UCS compute environments.

An understanding of PowerShell would also be helpful.

## UCS PowerTool
UCS PowerTool is a library of Microsoft PowerShell Cmdlets (pronounced command-lets) that enable the retrieval and manipulation of UCS Manager managed objects. UCS Manager API interaction can be categorized into several distinct sections.
* Sessions
* Methods
* Queries and Filters
* Configurations and Transactions
* Event Subscription

UCS PowerTool provides services and cmdlets for all the categorizations of UCS Manager API interactions, along with cmdlets that allow for the inspection of object metadata, object hierarchical containment and object cmdlet action capabilities with pipeline object definitions.

UCS PowerTool cmdlets follow the same structure as PowerShell cmdlets (verb-noun) utilizing the defined [Microsoft PowerShell Verbs.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714428%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) UCS PowerTool cmdlet nouns are the UCS objects. For example, to retrieve compute blade objects from UCS Manager, utilize the Get-UcsBlade cmdlet.  The Get-UcsBlade cmdlet will retrieve all the UCS compute blade objects from all currently connected UCS Managers.

## UCS PowerTool Download and Documentation
UCS PowerTool for UCS Manager is a component in the UCS PowerTool Suite.  In addition to UCS Manager management capabilities in UCS PowerTool, there is also a cmdlet library for UCS Central and UCS IMC. UCS Central PowerTool library provides cmdlets to manage UCS Central, UCS Central is a manager of UCS Managers. UCS IMC PowerTool is a collection of cmdlets to manage the CIMC (Cisco Integrated Management Controller) component of the UCS C and E Series servers.

To use UCS PowerTool in your environment be sure to [download](https://software.cisco.com/download/release.html?mdfid=286305108&flowid=&softwareid=284574017&release=2.0.1&relind=AVAILABLE&rellifecycle=&reltype=latest) and get the [documentation.](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/sw/msft_tools/powertools/ucs_powertool_book/UCSM_Pwrtool_UG_2x.html)

### Event Infrastructure Utilization

  If you are utilizing event provided infrastructure a script has been provided to reset the environment to pre-lab settings.

  On the desktop <strong>*Double-click*</strong> the `Reset-Ucs-LL` shortcut, provide the UCS Manager IP address that was assigned to you for the Learning Lab and hit <strong>*Enter*</strong>

  Repeat this process for each assigned IP address, if you were assigned more than one.

### Exercise 1
Launch UCS PowerTool, connect to a UCS Manager and disconnect from the UCS Manager.

  1. Launch UCS PowerTool by double clicking the UCS PowerTool icon on the Desktop.

  UCS PowerTool Icon:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-01.jpg)<br/><br/>

  2. A UCS PowerTool for UCS Manager Console will open, at the prompt type

  `Connect-Ucs -Name <ip-address-ucs-manager>`

  3. Use the credentials below in the login dialog

    User: admin

    Password: password

  Connect-Ucs credentials dialog:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-02.jpg)<br/><br/>

  4. View the results of a successful login.

  Connect-Ucs output:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-03.jpg)<br/><br/>

  There are several items shown in the console, these items are all attributes of the "login object" or "UCS PowerTool PS Session"

  5. Get the UCS PS Session, at the prompt type

  `Get-UcsPSSession`

  The output is the same as from the `Connect-Ucs` cmdlet.  There are several interesting components to a UCS PS Session, the `Cookie` is the authentication token for the current session. The `NoSsl` indicates is the session is secure or not, this could also be determined by the `Uri` value.

  Get-UcsPSSession output:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-04.jpg)<br/><br/>

  6. Disconnect from the UCS, at the prompt type

  `Disconnect-Ucs`

  Disconnect-Ucs output:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-05.jpg)<br/><br/>

  There is no output from `Disconnect-Ucs`

This is the end of exercise 1.
