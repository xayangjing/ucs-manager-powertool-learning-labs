# Intermediate UCS Python SDK Part I Cisco DevNet Learning Labs

### Exercise 4
Use the UCS Python SDK to add and delete NTP Servers

  1. Add NTP server object

    ```python
    from ucsmsdk.mometa.comm.CommNtpProvider import CommNtpProvider

    timezone_mo = handle.query_dn("sys/svc-ext/datetime-svc")

    ntp_mo = CommNtpProvider(parent_mo_or_dn=timezone_mo,name="10.10.10.20")

    handle.add_mo(ntp_mo)

    handle.commit()
    ```

    When adding an NTP server object you need to provide a parent object to add it to, in this case the parent object is the NTP service object. That is why the NTP service objects is retrieved first and then used as a parameter in the `add_mo` call.

  2. Retrieve the NTP server object

    ```python
    from ucsmsdk.mometa.comm.CommNtpProvider import CommNtpProvider

    ntp_mos = handle.query_classid("CommNtpProvider")

    for ntp_provider_mo in ntp_mos:
      print ntp_provider_mo
    ```

    Notice there are two objects per DNS server, this is new to the later releases of UCS Manager.  Updating either object will be reflected in the other. The original DNS Server object has a dn of `sys/svc-ext/datetime-svc/ntp-xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` The newer DNS object is a policy object.

  3. Delete the NTP server object

    To delete an object it as to first be found.  If the goal was to delete all objects of a specific type then it would be easy enough to query the class and iterate through the returned objects and delete each one.  However if a specific object is to be deleted then that object has to first be located. Locate a specific object with a dn query. Use the dn that starts with `sys/svc-ext`

    ```python
    ntp_mo = handle.query_dn("sys/svc-ext/datetime-svc/ntp-10.10.10.20")

    handle.remove_mo(ntp_mo)

    handle.commit()
    ```

### Exercise 5
Use the UCS Python SDK to add and delete DNS Servers

  1. Add DNS server objects

    The first thing you will notice is that the server objects are added exactly the same way, however in this exercise you will add two DNS servers in the same transaction.

    ```python
    from ucsmsdk.mometa.comm.CommDnsProvider import CommDnsProvider

    dns_service_mo = handle.query_dn("sys/svc-ext/dns-svc")

    for dns_server in "10.10.10.20","10.10.10.30":
      dns_mo = CommDnsProvider(parent_mo_or_dn=dns_service_mo,name=dns_server)
      handle.add_mo(dns_mo)

    handle.commit()

    dns_mos = handle.query_classid("CommDnsProvider",filter_str="(dn, 'sys/svc-ext/dns-svc/*', type='re')")

    for dns_provider_mo in dns_mos:
      print dns_provider_mo
    ```

    ![](/posts/files/ucsm-python-sdk-201/assets/images/ucsm-python-sdk-201-09.jpg)</br></br>

    Using a for loop each DNS server managed object was added to handle, creating a two object transaction. When the transaction is committed both objects are created.

    With respect to programming efficiency it is usually better to build multi-object transactions then to commit objects one at a time.

  2. Delete the DNS server objects

  ```python
  from ucsmsdk.mometa.comm.CommDnsProvider import CommDnsProvider

  dns_servers = handle.query_classid("CommDnsProvider")

  for dns_mo in dns_servers:
    handle.remove_mo(dns_mo)

  handle.commit()

  dns_servers = handle.query_classid("CommDnsProvider")

  print dns_provider_mo
  ```

This is the end of exercise 5
