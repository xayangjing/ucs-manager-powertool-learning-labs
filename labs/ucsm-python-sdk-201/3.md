### Exercise 6
Backup a UCS Configuration

There are several types of UCS Backups.

  - Full state — A binary file that includes a snapshot of the entire system. You can use the file generated from this backup to restore the system during disaster recovery. This file can restore or rebuild the configuration on the original fabric interconnect, or recreate the configuration on a different fabric interconnect. You cannot use this file for an import.

    - You can only use a full state backup file to restore a system that is running the same version as the system from which the backup file was exported.

    - A full state restore is not available via UCS PowerTool


  - All configuration — An XML file that includes all system and logical configuration settings. You can use the file generated from this backup to import these configuration settings to the original fabric interconnect or to a different fabric interconnect. You cannot use this file for a system restore. This file does not include passwords for locally authenticated users.

  - System configuration — An XML file that includes all system configuration settings such as usernames, roles, and locales. You can use the file generated from this backup to import these configuration settings to the original fabric interconnect or to a different fabric interconnect. You cannot use this file for a system restore.

  - Logical configuration — An XML file that includes all logical configuration settings such as service profiles, VLANs, VSANs, pools, and policies. You can use the file generated from this backup to import these configuration settings to the original fabric interconnect or to a different fabric interconnect. You cannot use this file for a system restore.

  Backups can be performed while the system is up and running. The backup operation only saves information from the management plane. It does not have any impact on the server or network traffic.


  1. Backup UCS Configuration

  ```python
  from ucsmsdk.utils.ucsbackup import backup_ucs

  backup_ucs(handle,"config-all","C:\ucs_scripts","config-all.xml")
  ```

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-python-sdk-201/assets/images/ucsm-python-sdk-201-11.jpg)</br></br>

  A config-all backup operation was performed and downloaded to `C:\ucs_scripts\config-all.xml`

  ```python
  def backup_ucs(handle, backup_type, file_dir, file_name, timeout_in_sec=600,
               preserve_pooled_values=False):
  Args:
    handle (UcsHandle): Ucs Connection handle

    backup_type (str): type of backup
      fullstate/config-logical/config-system/config-all

    file_dir (str): directory to download ucs backup file to

    file_name (str): name for the backup file
      (supported file extension are '.tar.gz' and '.xml')

    timeout_in_sec (number) : time in seconds for which method waits
      for the backUp file to generate before it exits.

    preserve_pooled_values (boolean): True/False,
      False - by default
  ```

  When creating a backup remember that the UcsHandle object has specific information about the currently connected UCS. This information could be very useful when building the backup filename.

    - IP Address - handle.ip
    - UCS Name - handle.ucs
    - UCS Version - handle.version
    - UCS User - handle.username

  2. Import UCS Configuration

  ```python
  from ucsmsdk.utils.ucsbackup import import_ucs_backup

  import_ucs_backup(handle,"C:\ucs_scripts","config-all.xml",True)
  ```
  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-python-sdk-201/assets/images/ucsm-python-sdk-201-12.jpg)</br></br>

  The backup file is imported and merged with the existing configuration.

  ```python
  def import_ucs_backup(handle, file_dir, file_name, merge=False):

  Args:
    handle (UcsHandle): connection handle

    file_dir (str): directory containing ucs backup file

    file_name (str): backup file name to be imported

    merge (boolean): True/False, specifies whether to

    merge the backup configuration with the existing UCSM configuration
  ```

    This is the end of Exercise 6.

  This concludes the lab ucsm-python-sdk-201.
