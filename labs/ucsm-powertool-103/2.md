# Introduction to UCS PowerTool Part III Cisco DevNet Learning Labs

### Exercise 3
There are about 2,150 UCS PowerTool cmdlets which might sound a bit daunting, how will you ever find the correct cmdlet for the desired operation. Fortunately there is a cmdlet that will help considerably in writing PowerShell scripts that use UCS PowerTool.

`ConvertTo-UcsCmdlet` will monitor the UCS Manager GUI log file and when create, update or delete operations are detected in the logfile the cmdlet or series of cmdlets to do the same operation in PowerTool will display in the PowerTool console.

  1. If you are disconnected from the UCS Manager follow the initial steps from Exercise 1 to launch UCS PowerTool and connect to UCS Manager with the `-NoSsl` option.

  `Connect-Ucs -Name <ip-address-ucs-manager> -NoSsl`

  User: admin

  Password: password

  2. Next launch a UCS Manager graphical interface session, at the command prompt type

  `Start-UcsGuiSession`

  If you get prompted "Do you want to run this application?" *click* the "Run" button after few moments the UCS Manager GUI will start.

  3. *click* on the "LAN" tab then *click* the plus sign next to VLANs to expand the VLANs section

  4. Run `ConvertTo-UcsCmdlet` in the PowerTool console at the command prompt type

  `ConvertTo-UcsCmdlet`

  ConvertTo-UcsCmdlet:

  Notice that the command prompt did not come back.

  5. In UCS Manager create a VLAN, *right click* on VLANS then *click* "Create VLANs" on the context menu

  Create VLANs context menu:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-103/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-103-12.jpg)</br></br>

  6. In the "Create VLANs" window name the VLAN `vlan100` and provide a VLAN ID of `100`

  Create VLANs Window:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-103/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-103-13.jpg)</br></br>

  7. *Click* "OK" to submit the Create VLANs dialog

  8. *Click* "OK" to clear the success dialog

  VLAN Create Success message:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-103/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-103-14.jpg)</br></br>

  vlan100 should now appear in the VLAN list

  But also in the PowerTool console the UCS PowerTool cmdlet code to create a VLAN has appeared.

  If you have done the previous labs you should be familiar with the VLAN creation code.

  9. Delete the VLAN, *right click* on vlan100 then *click* "Delete" on the context menu, *click* "Yes" on the Delete confirmation dialog. *Click* "OK" on the Deletion success dialog.

  VLAN Deletion:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-103/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-103-18.jpg)</br></br>

  The VLAN deletion cmdlet code has also appeared in the UCS PowerTool console.

  10. Leave the UCS Manager Open for exercise 4.

  This is the end of exercise 3.

### Exercise 4
Create a more complex UCS Object that is a multi-object object, a boot policy.

  1. In UCS Manager *click* the "Servers" tab in the upper left-hand navigation, then *right click* "Boot Policies" and *click* "Create Boot Policy" on the context menu.

  Server Boot Policy:

  2. Give the Boot Policy a name "new-boot", *click* the "Local Devices" tray down arrow to open the tray, *click* "Add Local Disk". "Local Disk 1" will appear in the "Boot Order" area. To finish the Boot Policy creation *click* "OK". *Click* "OK" on the "Create Boot Policy" dialog.

  Add Disk to Boot Policy:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-103/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-103-21.jpg)</br></br>

  View the Boot Policy creation Cmdlets in the UCS PowerTool console

  Boot Policy Creation Cmdlets:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-103/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-103-22.jpg)</br></br>

  As you can see there is a bit more complexity to a Boot Policy than there was to a VLAN, lets breakdown the code.

  ```PowerShell
  Start-UcsTransaction
  $mo = Get-UcsOrg -Level root  | Add-UcsBootPolicy -BootMode "legacy" -Descr "" -EnforceVnicName "yes" -Name "new-boot" -PolicyOwner "local" -RebootOnUpdate "no"
  $mo_1 = $mo | Add-UcsLsbootStorage -Order 1
  $mo_1_1 = $mo_1 | Add-UcsLsbootLocalStorage
  $mo_1_1_1 = $mo_1_1 | Add-UcsLsbootDefaultLocalImage -Order 1
  Complete-UcsTransaction
  ```
    1. Start a UCS Transaction
    2. Create the Boot Policy object in the "root" organization and store the object in $mo (managed object)
    3. Add an lsbootStorage object to $mo and call the new object $mo_1
    4. Add an lsbootLocalStorage object to $mo_1 and call the new object $mo_1_1
    5. Add an lsbootDefaultLocalImage object to $mo_1_1 and call the new object $mo_1_1_1
    6. Complete the UCS Transaction

  3. Delete the Boot Policy in UCS Manager GUI. *Click* the "+" sign next to "Boot Policies" to expand the section, *right-click* on "Boot Policy new-boot" and *click* "Delete" in the context menu. *Click* "OK" in the Delete Boot Policy dialog, *click* "OK" in the successful deletion dialog.

  Delete Boot Policy:

  4. View the Boot Policy Deletion Cmdlets in the PowerTool console.

  Delete Boot Policy Cmdlets:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-103/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-103-24.jpg)</br></br>

  5. In the PowerTool Console type ctrl-c to break out of `ConvertTo-UcsCmdlet`

  6. Disconnect from the UCS Manager, at the command prompt type

  `Disconnect-Ucs`

  This is the end of exercise 4.

This concludes the lab ucsm-powertool-103
