# Introduction to UCS PowerTool Part II Cisco DevNet Learning Labs

### Exercise 5
The ClassId of a UCS VLAN object is `fabricVlan`. The class of an object is not an attribute of the object that can be selected as output. Object Class ID can be determined in a number of ways. The easiest way is to utilize the "Copy XML" function in the context menu of a UCS Object.

Determine the Class ID of a UCS Object using the "Copy XML" context menu item in the UCS Manager GUI.

  1. If you are disconnected from the UCS Manager follow the initial steps from Exercise 2 to launch UCS PowerTool and connect to UCS Manager with the `-NoSsl` option. Next launch a UCS Manager graphical interface session, at the command prompt type just as you did is exercise 2

  `Start-UcsGuiSession`

  If you get prompted "Do you want to run this application?" *click* the "Run" button after few moments the UCS Manager GUI will start.

  2. *click* on the "LAN" tab then *click* the plus sign next to VLANs to expand the VLANs section

  If everything worked as expected up to this point there should only be a single VLAN, *right click* on "VLAN default (1)"

  The XML that represents a VLAN object is now in the clipboard, create a new text file on the desktop and paste the contents into it.

  The Class ID of a UCS object is the XML element name, in this case `fabricVlan` is the element name, all the properties of a fabricVlan are the XML element attributes. UCS VLAN objects can contain child objects, however the "Copy XML" menu item will only copy the `fabricVlan` object XML.

  ```XML
  <fabricVlan
    assocPrimaryVlanState="ok"
    assocPrimaryVlanSwitchId="NONE"
    childAction="deleteNonPresent"
    cloud="ethlan"
    compressionType="included"
    configIssues=""
    defaultNet="yes"
    dn="fabric/lan/net-default"
    epDn="" fltAggr="0"
    global="0"
    id="1"
    ifRole="network"
    ifType="virtual"
    local="0"
    locale="external"
    mcastPolicyName=""
    name="default"
    operMcastPolicyName="org-root/mc-policy-default"
    operState="ok" overlapStateForA="active"
    overlapStateForB="active"
    peerDn=""
    policyOwner="local"
    pubNwDn=""
    pubNwId="1"
    pubNwName=""
    sharing="none"
    switchId="dual"
    transport="ether"
    type="lan"
  />
  ```
This is the end of exercise 5.

### Exercise 6
UCS Manager API create, update, delete interactions so far have been single entity interactions. We used a PowerShell range operator to repeatedly call the `Add-UcsVlan`, `Set-UcsVlan` and `Remove-UcsVlan` cmlets. Each time a call was made to UCS Manager only a single object was acted upon. We even put the `lanCloud` object in a PowerShell variable to only make the call to `Get-UcsLanCloud` a single time, instead of each time a VLAN was to be operated on.

For a small number of interactions this methodology will suffice and the response from UCS Manager will be acceptable.  However UCS Manager supports multi-object transactions. The objects do not have to be the same nor do that have to have a relationship to each other. UCS Manager processes the object requests one at a time until the end of the objects is reached in the transaction. A couple of things to point out are that the objects are not guaranteed to be processed in the order they are added to the transaction, nor can the objects in the transaction have a dependency on each other.

UCS Manager Object operations are ACID compliant

* Atomic
* Consistent
* Isolated
* Durable

For example suppose there were three VLAN creations in a UCS Transaction, the first two VLANs were created without issue but the third failed. The two successfully created VLANs would be rolled back and the entire transaction would fail. No other users would have ever seen the two successfully created VLANs because two out three things completing would not satisfy ACID rules. As well, if the third VLAN was a community VLAN that depended on the first or second VLAN the third would fail because objects in the transaction can not have a dependency on other objects in the transaction.

Create and delete a range of VLANs using UCS transactions.

  1. UCS PowerTool keeps track of transactions. There are two attributes in the UCS PSSession object that indicate a transaction in progress. At the command prompt type

  `Get-UcsPSSession`

  Get-UcsPSSession:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-102/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-102-13.jpg)</br></br>

  Notice the attributes `NumPendingConfigs` and `TransactionInProgress`

  `NumPendingConfigs` is 0

  `TransactionInProgress` is False

  2. Start a UCS Transaction, at the command prompt type

  `Start-UcsTransaction`

  Start-UcsTransaction:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-102/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-102-12.jpg)</br></br>

  Wow! Oh wait nothing happened. Hold on, look at the UCS PSSession again, at the command prompt type

  `Get-UcsPSSession`

  Get-UcsPSSession after Start-UcsTransaction:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-102/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-102-14.jpg)</br></br>

  `TransactionInProgress` is True

  3. Get the UCS lanCloud into a variable, at the command prompt type

  `$lanCloud = Get-UcsLanCloud`

  4. With the fabricLanCloud object stored in a variable let's add a VLAN, at the command prompt type

  `Add-UcsVlan -LanCloud $lanCloud -Name vlan100 -Id 100`

  `Add-UcsVlan -LanCloud $lanCloud -Name vlan101 -Id 101`

  Add-UcsVlan with a transaction:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-102/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-102-15.jpg)</br></br>

  5. Get the UCS PSSession again, at the command prompt type

  `Get-UcsPSSession`

  Get-UcsPSSession with some transactions

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-102/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-102-16.jpg)</br></br>

  Now the value for `NumPendingConfigs` is 2, also if you were watching in the UCS Manager GUI no new VLANs have been added.

  6. Complete the transaction, at the command prompt type

  `Complete-UcsTransaction`

  Complete-UcsTransaction:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-102/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-102-17.jpg)</br></br>

  Just like running the cmdlets one at a time the information for the created object is echoed on the console for each created object. As well the VLANs now are visible in the UCS Manager GUI.

  7. Delete the VLANs with a transaction, at the command prompt type

  `Start-UcsTransaction`

  `Get-UcsVlan -Id 100 | Remove-UcsVlan`

  `Get-UcsVlan -Id 101 | Remove-UcsVlan`

  `Complete-UcsTransaction -Force`

  Now the VLAN objects have been removed and are no longer visible in UCS Manager GUI

  6. Disconnect from UCS Manager, at the command prompt type

  `Disconnect-Ucs`

This is the end of exercise 6.

This concludes the lab ucsm-powertool-102
