# Introduction to UCS PowerTool Part II Cisco DevNet Learning Labs

## Overview
UCS PowerTool is a library of PowerShell Cmdlets that enable the management of UCS environments from Microsoft Operating Systems, via the UCS XML API.

Cisco UCS is an Integrated Compute Infrastructure that has supported an XML API since its introduction. UCS Manager is the service that provides the XML API endpoint along with a graphical interface and a command line.  The UCS components both physical and logical are represented as XML objects in a hierarchical Object Model format and can be manipulated via the XML API.

All UCS objects are described in an XML schema, this schema defines the objects their attributes and associated values. The schema is also used to generate more than 98% of the UCS PowerTool Library. Because a UCS component must be part of the Object Model to be part of the UCS system all components of UCS are always available via the XML API.

## Objective
This Introduction to UCS PowerTool Learning Lab will guide you through the use of UCS PowerTool to connect to a UCS Manager, perform queries against UCS Manager objects, create new objects, modify objects and disconnect from the UCS Manager. UCS Manager Objects are representations of pools, policies, other logical constructs and physical entities.

Completion time: 30 minutes

## Prerequisites
Prior to starting this learning lab it would be helpful to understand UCS Manager and the functionality that it provides to manage UCS compute environments.

An understanding of PowerShell would also be helpful.

## UCS PowerTool
UCS PowerTool is a library of Microsoft PowerShell Cmdlets (pronounced command-lets) that enable the retrieval and manipulation of UCS Manager managed objects. UCS Manager API interaction can be categorized into several distinct sections.
* Sessions
* Methods
* Queries and Filters
* Configurations and Transactions
* Event Subscription

UCS PowerTool provides services and cmdlets for all the categorizations of UCS Manager API interactions, along with cmdlets that allow for the inspection of object metadata, object hierarchical containment and object cmdlet action capabilities with pipeline object definitions.

UCS PowerTool cmdlets follow the same structure as PowerShell cmdlets (verb-noun) utilizing the defined [Microsoft PowerShell Verbs.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714428%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) UCS PowerTool cmdlet nouns are the UCS objects. For example, to retrieve compute blade objects from UCS Manager, utilize the Get-UcsBlade cmdlet.  The Get-UcsBlade cmdlet will retrieve all the UCS compute blade objects from all currently connected UCS Managers.

## UCS PowerTool Download and Documentation
UCS PowerTool for UCS Manager is a component in the UCS PowerTool Suite.  In addition to UCS Manager management capabilities in UCS PowerTool, there is also a cmdlet library for UCS Central and UCS IMC. UCS Central PowerTool library provides cmdlets to manage UCS Central, UCS Central is a manager of UCS Managers. UCS IMC PowerTool is a collection of cmdlets to manage the CIMC (Cisco Integrated Management Controller) component of the UCS C and E Series servers.

To use UCS PowerTool in your environment be sure to [download](https://software.cisco.com/download/release.html?mdfid=286305108&flowid=&softwareid=284574017&release=2.0.1&relind=AVAILABLE&rellifecycle=&reltype=latest) and get the [documentation.](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/sw/msft_tools/powertools/ucs_powertool_book/UCSM_Pwrtool_UG_2x.html)

### Event Infrastructure Utilization

  If you are utilizing event provided infrastructure a script has been provided to reset the environment to pre-lab settings.

  On the desktop <strong>*Double-click*</strong> the `Reset-Ucs-LL` shortcut, provide the UCS Manager IP address that was assigned to you for the Learning Lab and hit <strong>*Enter*</strong>

  Repeat this process for each assigned IP address, if you were assigned more than one.

### Exercise 1
There are over 9000 objects in the UCS Object Model, embedded in the [UCS Platform Emulator (UCSPE)](https://communities.cisco.com/docs/DOC-66688) is the UCS Object XML schema definition, this alone is worth the download of the UCSPE. The XML schema is divided into two files an input and an output. Standard XML toolsets can utilize the schema, e.g. xmllint.

Typically at Cisco Live or other DevNet developer events the UCS Platform Emulator is utilized as it provides the same exact functionality as the actual UCS Manager that is embedded in a Fabric Interconnect.  The UCS PE is freely available from the Cisco Communities link above.

The majority of the cmdlets in UCS PowerTool library are generated from the schema.  Of the approximately 2,150 cmdlets in the library 2,100 are generated.

Utilizing standard PowerShell cmdlets we can get view the cmdlets in the UCS PowerTool library.

  1. Launch UCS PowerTool by double clicking the UCS PowerTool icon on the Desktop.

  UCS PowerTool Icon:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-102/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-102-01.jpg)</br></br>

  2. Utilize the `Get-Command` PowerShell cmdlet to view the cmdlets in the UCS PowerTool library, at the command prompt type

  `Get-Command -Module Cisco.UCSManager | more`

  Get-Command:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-102/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-102-02.jpg)</br></br>

  3. Spacebar through the cmdlet list and you will notice that there are Aliases, Functions, Add, Gets, Sets, Removes, etc.

  4. To get the actual number of Aliases, Functions and cmdlets in the UCS PowerTool library use the PowerShell `Measure-Object` cmdlet in conjunction with the `Get-Command` cmdlet. At the command prompt type

  `Get-Command -Module Cisco.UCSManager | Measure-Object`


    The output will look similar to this

    Count    : 2156
    Average  :
    Sum      :
    Maximum  :
    Minimum  :
    Property :

  Depending upon the version of UCS PowerTool the actual count may vary from what is shown here.

  5. As stated earlier in this document the UCS PowerTool cmdlets follow the PowerShell action-object/verb-noun format.  To see the verbs utilized in the UCS PowerTool libary is easily done using standard PowerShell cmdlets.

  At the command prompt type

  `Get-Command -Module Cisco.UCSManager | ?{$_.Name -match "-"} | %{$_.Name.Substring(0,$_.Name.IndexOf("-"))} | Sort-Object -Unique`

  Let's breakdown what this command does.
    1. Get the commands in the Cisco.UCSManager Module
    2. Where the pipeline object attribute Name has a "-" in it, pipeline the object
    3. ForEach pipelined object print the substring of the Name attribute from the beginning of the Name up to the first "-"
    4. Sort each pipelined substring of the Name attribute and create a unique list.


  The resulting output is

    Acknowledge
    Add
    Associate
    Backup
    Clear
    Compare
    Complete
    Confirm
    Connect
    ConvertTo
    Copy
    Decommission
    Disable
    Disassociate
    Disconnect
    Enable
    Export
    Get
    Import
    Invoke
    Recommission
    Register
    Remove
    Rename
    Reset
    Restart
    Send
    Set
    Start
    Stop
    Sync
    Undo
    Unregister
    Update
    Watch

  This is the end of exercise 1.

### Exercise 2
Connect to a UCS Manager in `-NoSsl` mode and turn off http to https redirect.

  1. Connect to the UCS Manager in `-NoSsl` mode

  `Connect-Ucs -Name <ip-address-ucs-manager> -NoSsl`

  User: admin

  Password: password

  Connect-Ucs credentials dialog:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-102/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-102-03.jpg)</br></br>

  Connect-Ucs -NoSsl output:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-102/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-102-04.jpg)</br></br>

  Notice that the `Uri` attribute is http and not https. We connected in this manner to eliminate any certificate issues when launching the UCS Graphical interface.

  2. Since the UCS Platform Emulator ships with redirect of http to https turned on, let's turn it off. At the command prompt type

  `Get-UcsHttp`


  The output will look like this

    AdminState    : enabled
    Descr         : HTTP Service
    Name          : http
    OperPort      : 80
    PolicyLevel   : 0
    PolicyOwner   : local
    Port          : 80
    Proto         : tcp
    RedirectState : enabled
    Sacl          :
    Ucs           : UCSPE-192-168-65-143
    Dn            : sys/svc-ext/http-svc
    Rn            : http-svc
    Status        :
    XtraProperty  : {}

  Notice that the attribute `RedirectState` is set to `enabled`

  *It is possible that the `RedirectState` attribute is already set to `disabled`*

  At the command prompt type

  `Get-UcsHttp | Set-UcsHttp -RedirectState disabled -Force`


The output will look like this

    AdminState    : enabled
    Descr         : HTTP Service
    Name          : http
    OperPort      : 80
    PolicyLevel   : 0
    PolicyOwner   : local
    Port          : 80
    Proto         : tcp
    RedirectState : disabled
    Sacl          :
    Ucs           : UCSPE-192-168-65-143
    Dn            : sys/svc-ext/http-svc
    Rn            : http-svc
    Status        :
    XtraProperty  : {}

  The attribute `RedirectState` has been set to `disabled`


Let's breakdown what this command does

  1. `Get-UcsHttp` gets from UCS manager the http communication object. The Object ClassId√Ç of the http communication object is `commHttp` the dn is `sys/svc-ext/http-svc`
  2. `Set-UcsHttp` has a default pipeline object of `commHttp` so the object does not need to be spcified. `Set-UcsHttp` will look in the pipeline for the required object. The `-RedirectState` parameter is set to `disabled`
  3. without the `-Force` parameter you would have been prompted for confirmation.

  As a final step run `Get-Help` on `Get-UcsHttp` and `Set-UcsHttp` at the command prompt type

  `Get-Help Get-UcsHttp`

  `Get-Help Set-UcsHttp`

This is the end of exercise 2.
