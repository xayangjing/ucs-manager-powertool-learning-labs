# Introduction to UCS PowerTool Part II Cisco DevNet Learning Labs

### Exercise 3
Launch UCS Graphical Session from UCS PowerTool session, query the UCS Lan VLANs.
  1. If you are disconnected from the UCS Manager follow the initial steps from Exercise 2 to launch UCS PowerTool and connect to UCS Manager with the `-NoSsl` option. Next launch a UCS Manager graphical interface session, at the command prompt type

  `Start-UcsGuiSession`

  If you get prompted "Do you want to run this application?" *click* the "Run" button after few moments the UCS Manager GUI will start.

  2. *click* on the "LAN" tab then *click* the plus sign next to VLANs to expand the VLANs section

  3. In the PowerTool session at the command prompt type

  `Get-UcsLanCloud | Get-UcsVlan -SwitchId dual | Select-Object Dn, Id, Name`

  The output will look like this


    Dn                     Id Name
    --                     -- ----
    fabric/lan/net-default  1 default

This is the end of exercise 3.

### Exercise 4
Create a single VLAN, update the VLAN, delete the VLAN. Create a range of VLANs delete a range of VLANs.

VLAN objects are children of the UCS Lan Cloud object. To create a VLAN or any other entity in the UCS Manager the containing object needs to be supplied in the the `Add` cmdlet for that object. The `Add-UcsVlan` cmdlet will create a UCS VLAN, however the `Add-UcsVlan` cmdlet needs as input the Lan Cloud object.

  1. To add a UCS VLAN object at the command prompt type

  `Get-UcsLanCloud | Add-UcsVlan -Name vlan100 -Id 100`

  If you can position on your desktop the UCS PowerTool window so that is does not obscure the UCS Manager GUI window you will see the VLAN appear immediately in the VLAN section.

  2. To add multiple VLANs use PowerShell's range notation to create a range of VLAN IDs. At the command prompt type

  `$lanCloud = Get-UcsLanCloud`

  This sets the variable lanCloud to hold the lanCloud object. The ClassId for UCS Lan Cloud is `fabricLanCloud`

  3. To see the object in $lanCloud at the command prompt type
  `$lanCloud`

  4. With the fabricLanCloud object stored in a variable let's use the range notation to generate VLAN IDs at the command prompt type

  `101..110 | ForEach-Object {Add-UcsVlan -LanCloud $lanCloud -Name vlan$_ -Id $_}`

  Add-UcsVlan:

  Now there are 10 new VLANs in addition to the one previously created. While the command was runnning the output of the successive VLAN creation operations was output on the console.

  5. View the `Sharing` attribute of VLAN 100 at the command prompt type

  `Get-UcsVlan -Id 100`

  And view the properties for the single VLAN object, specifically the `Sharing` attribute.

  6. Update the `Sharing` attribute of the VLANs from `none` to `community` at the command prompt type

  `100..110 | ForEach-Object {Get-UcsVlan -Id $_ | Set-UcsVlan -Sharing community -Force}`

  In this operation `Get-UcsVlan` was used with the `-Id` parameter to get the objects one at a time and then pipeline the object to `Set-UcsVlan` the `community` `Sharing` attribute value was specified as was the `-Force` option to force the update of the objects.

  UCS PowerTool cmdlets are written to support all the PowerShell common parameters. Try the same cmdlet above with the `Sharing set to `none` and the `-WhatIf` option instead of the `-Force` option to see what would happen if the `Set` operation was allowed to run. At the command prompt type

  `100..110 | ForEach-Object {Get-UcsVlan -Id $_ | Set-UcsVlan -Sharing none -Force}`

  Set-UcsVlan with -WhatIf:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-102/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-102-09.jpg)

  7. Delete the VLANs in the same way they were `Set` using the `Remove-UcsVlan` cmdlet at the command prompt type

  `100..110 | ForEach-Object {Get-UcsVlan -Id $_ | Remove-UcsVlan -Force}`

  And the VLANs are gone.

This is the end of exercise 4.
