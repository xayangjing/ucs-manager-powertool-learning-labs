# Introduction to UCS Python SDK Part I Cisco DevNet Learning Labs

### Exercise 1e - Connecting / Disconnecting from UCS Manager:

  In this next example, we will use the UcsHandle class (from the ucshandle module) to connect to a UCS Manager.   The UCS Platform Emulator (UCSPE)  will accept ANY login credentials.

  Run the following commands to authenticate against the UCS Manager XML API, and establish a session.

  -	Note:  the <strong>class or function name</strong> (derived from help) needs to be specified and is <strong>case sensitive</strong>

  ```Python
	handle = UcsHandle("<ucs-manager-ip>", "admin", "passsword")
	handle.login()
  ```

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-python-sdk-101/assets/images/ucsm-python-sdk-101-09.png)</br></br>

  Use the vars() function to view the new handle object, and view the various properties and attributes of this class.  

  -	This will display the UCSM Session information (UCS Domain name, user privileges, session cookie, cookie refresh period):

	`vars(handle)`

  Now logout from the UCS Manager

  `handle.logout()`

### Exercise 1f - Launch the UCS Manager Java GUI

  Next we will login back into the UCS Manager, and launch the UCS Manager JAVA GUI (via http). This time when creating the handle we'll deactivate https.

  ```Python
  handle = UcsHandle("<ucs-manager-ip>","admin","passsword",secure=False)
  handle.login()
  ```

  In order to launch the UCSM Java GUI, we will be using the function "ucs_gui_launch" defined in the module "ucsguilaunch", which is located in this folder:  ucsmsdk\utils directory, specified as follows:

  ```Python
  from ucsmsdk.utils.ucsguilaunch import ucs_gui_launch
	ucs_gui_launch(handle)
  ```

  The UCS Manager Java file will download and launch in the local Java client:

  The ucs_gui_launch() function requires access to the registry, is the registry cannot be accesed by the current user the following error message will be displayed.

  2016-06-22 07:47:05,599 - ucs - DEBUG - AuthToken: <26169282651027923153591></br>
  2016-06-22 07:47:05,608 - ucs - DEBUG - UCSM URL: <http://10.10.110.101:80/ucsm/ucsm.jnlp?ucsmToken=26169282651027923153591></br>
  2016-06-22 07:47:05,615 - ucs - DEBUG - Not able to access registry.</br>
  2016-06-22 07:47:05,622 - ucs - DEBUG - Not able to access registry.</br>

  If `ucs_gui_launch()` is unable to access it can be utilized to provide a url with a token

  ```Python
	ucs_gui_launch(handle, need_url=True)
  ```

  Copy and paste the output url into a browser.

### Exercise 1g - Using convert_to_ucs_python() to discover Python Code

  Next we will use a special function: convert_to_ucs_python(), which has the ability to listen to the UCSM JAVA GUI logfile, identify configuration changes and convert these to their Python Equivalent.

  -	A powerful, simple to use tool for discovering Python automation code.
  -	This function is contained in the "converttopython" module, located in the "utils" directory:

  ```python
  from ucsmsdk.utils.converttopython import convert_to_ucs_python
	convert_to_ucs_python()
  ```

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-python-sdk-101/assets/images/ucsm-python-sdk-101-12.png)</br></br>

  Notice how the local UCSM Java GUI log file is identified above (centrale_xxxx.log)

  -	This log file will now be monitored for any configuration created/saved via the UCSM Java GUI.
  -	This function will run continuously, until a "control+c" is executed to break back to the shell.

### Exercise 1h - Create a VLAN in the GUI; discover the Python code equivalent

  In the UCSM Java GUI

  1. Navigate to the LAN Tab
  2. *Right-click* on VLANs (under LAN Cloud)
  3. *Click* "Create VLANs"
  4. Name the VLAN "vlan10"
  5. Set the VLAN ID to 10
  6. *Click* OK to create the VLAN
  7. *Click* OK on the Create VLANs Success dialog

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-python-sdk-101/assets/images/ucsm-python-sdk-101-13.png)</br></br>

  Notice that after the VLAN is created, the Python shell displays the Python Code needed to repeat this same task. This provides a powerful method of discovering Python code to automate (anything) in UCS!

  Note:  this output will be used in the next lab.

  Delete VLAN 10 from the UCS Manager GUI

  1. *Click* on the "+" sign next to VLANs
  2. *Right-click* on vlan10
  3. *Click*
  5. *Click* Yes
  6. *Click* OK on the Delete Success Dialog

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-python-sdk-101/assets/images/ucsm-python-sdk-101-15.png)</br></br>

  Now logout from the UCS Manager

  `handle.logout()`

  Close the UCS Java GUI

This concludes the lab ucsm-python-sdk-101
