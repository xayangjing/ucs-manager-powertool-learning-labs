### Exercise 2
Add/Remove NTP Servers and DNS Servers

  1. Add NTP Servers

  `Add-UcsNtpServer -Timezone America/Lima -Name 10.10.10.10`

  Add-UcsNtpServer failed:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-201/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-201-08.jpg)<br/><br/>

  The Add command failed because the `-Timezone` parameter that the Add command requires is not a string but a UCS Manager Timezone object. First Get the Timezone object then add an NTP server.

  2. Add NTP Servers

  `Get-UcsTimezone | Add-UcsNtpServer -Name 10.10.10.10`

  Add-UcsNtpServer:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-201/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-201-09.jpg)<br/><br/>

  3. Add another server

  `Get-UcsTimezone | Add-UcsNtpServer -Name ntp1.ntp.com`

  Now there are two NTP servers

  4. Verify that there are two NTP servers and only print out the name and AdminState of the NTP servers

  `Get-UcsNtpServer | Select-Object Name, AdminState`

  Get-UcsNtpServer:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-201/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-201-10.jpg)<br/><br/>

  NTP information is stored in more than one NTP object, that is why there are duplicates in the output.

  5. Delete NTP Servers

  `Get-UcsNtpServer | Remove-UcsNtpServer -Force`

  Without the `-Force` parameter, the command would prompt for deletion confirmation for each NTP Server object that was found in UCS Manager.

  Remove-UcsNtpServer:

    ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-201/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-201-11.jpg)<br/><br/>

  6. Add DNS server

  `Get-UcsDns | Add-UcsDnsServer -Name 10.10.10.10`

  Add-UcsDnsServer:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-201/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-201-12.jpg)<br/><br/>

  Similar to the NTP servers being objects under the Timezone Object.  The DNS Servers are objects under the DNS Object.

  7. Add another DNS server

  `Get-UcsDns | Add-UcsDnsServer -Name 10.10.10.20`

  8. Remove-UcsDnsServer

  `Get-UcsDnsServer -Name 10.10.10.10 | Remove-UcsDnsServer -Force`

  In the above example the specific DNS server that we wish to delete is retrieved and then pipelined to the Remove-UcsDnsServer cmdlet.  This is different than the NTP server deletion because we are specifying a specific DNS server to remove, not all of them.

  This is the end of Exercise 2.
