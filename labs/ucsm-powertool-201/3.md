### Exercise 3
Backup a UCS Configuration

There are several types of UCS Backups.

  - Full state — A binary file that includes a snapshot of the entire system. You can use the file generated from this backup to restore the system during disaster recovery. This file can restore or rebuild the configuration on the original fabric interconnect, or recreate the configuration on a different fabric interconnect. You cannot use this file for an import.

    - You can only use a full state backup file to restore a system that is running the same version as the system from which the backup file was exported.

    - A full state restore is not available via UCS PowerTool


  - All configuration — An XML file that includes all system and logical configuration settings. You can use the file generated from this backup to import these configuration settings to the original fabric interconnect or to a different fabric interconnect. You cannot use this file for a system restore. This file does not include passwords for locally authenticated users.

  - System configuration — An XML file that includes all system configuration settings such as usernames, roles, and locales. You can use the file generated from this backup to import these configuration settings to the original fabric interconnect or to a different fabric interconnect. You cannot use this file for a system restore.

  - Logical configuration — An XML file that includes all logical configuration settings such as service profiles, VLANs, VSANs, pools, and policies. You can use the file generated from this backup to import these configuration settings to the original fabric interconnect or to a different fabric interconnect. You cannot use this file for a system restore.

  Backups can be performed while the system is up and running. The backup operation only saves information from the management plane. It does not have any impact on the server or network traffic.


  1. Backup UCS Configuration

  `Backup-Ucs -Type config-all -PathPattern C:\ucs_scripts\config-all.xml`

  Backup-Ucs:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-201/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-201-13.jpg)<br/><br/>

  This is the simplest UCS backup the XML file config-all is copied to the C:\ucs_scripts directory

  The `-Type` parameter values are

    - config-all - for All Configuration
    - config-logical - for Logical Configuration
    - config-system - for System Configuration
    - full-state - for Full state

  2. Backup UCS with a PathPattern

  `Backup-Ucs -Type config-logical -PathPattern 'C:\ucs_scripts\${ucs}-${yyyy}${MM}${dd}-${HH}${mm}-config-logical.xml'`

  The PathPattern used here created the following filename

  `C:\ucs_scripts\UCSPE-192-168-220-148-20161006-2201-config-logical.xml`

  The PathPattern variables are fairly self explanatory

    - ucs - Name of the UCS System
    - yyyy - four digit year
    - MM - two digit month
    - dd - two digit day
    - HH - two digit hour (24 hour clock)
    - mm - two digit minute

  3. Import UCS Configuration

  `Import-UcsBackup -Merge -LiteralPath C:\ucs_scripts\config.xml`

  Import-UcsBackup:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-201/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-201-13.jpg)<br/><br/>

  When the -Merge parameter is specified the UCS configuration in the specified file will be merged with the existing configurations on the UCS Manager. If -Merge is not specified then the configuration read from the specified file will replace the existing UCS configuration.

  These UCS Backup operations exported and imported UCS configurations from the local machine.  UCS Manager also supports exports and imports via ftp, scp, sftp and tftp protocols.  Additionally UCS backups of Full State and All Configuration can be scheduled for daily, weekly and bi weekly operations.

This is the end of exercise 3.
