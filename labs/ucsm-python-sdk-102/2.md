# Introduction to UCS Python SDK Part II Cisco DevNet Learning Labs

### Exercise 2d - CREATE – Create a new UCS Scrub Policy (via ucsmsdk_samples)

  Next we will use the samples contained in the ucsmsdk_samples directory to create a new object, edit that object and then delete object.  We will be using "scrub_policy" for these examples.

  Locate the scrub_policy script, located under the ucsmsdk_samples\server directory and then right-click to "Edit in IDLE":

  Notice that the function needed to create a scrub policy is "scrub_policy_create" – the script details the available arguments, and further down provides a functional example:

  If your convert_to_ucs_python session is still running, issue a "control+c" to issue a KeyboardInterrupt and exit back to the Python Shell.

  You can use `vars(handle) to make sure you are still logged into UCS Manager – log back in if necessary:

  In the Python shell window, execute the following commands to create a Scrub Policy in UCSM:

  ```python
  from ucsmsdk_samples.server.scrub_policy import scrub_policy_create

  scrub_policy_create(handle, name="sample_scrub",flex_flash_scrub="yes", bios_settings_scrub="no",parent_dn="org-root")
  ```

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-python-sdk-102/assets/images/ucsm-python-sdk-102-11.png)</br></br>

  You should see the new object in the UCS Manager GUI:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-python-sdk-102/assets/images/ucsm-python-sdk-102-12.png)</br></br>

### Exercise 2e - MODIFY – Modify the Scrub Policy

  Review the scrub_policy.py script and locate the function to modify:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-python-sdk-102/assets/images/ucsm-python-sdk-102-13.png)</br></br>

  Run the following commands to modify the new scrub policy "sample_scrub" and change the "lex_flash_scrub" property from "yes" to "no" – you should see the change in the UCS Manager GUI as well:

  ```python
  from ucsmsdk_samples.server.scrub_policy import scrub_policy_modify

  scrub_policy_modify(handle,name="sample_scrub",flex_flash_scrub="no",parent_dn="org-root")
  ```

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-python-sdk-102/assets/images/ucsm-python-sdk-102-14.png)</br></br>

### Exercise 2f - DELETE - Delete the Scrub Policy

  Execute the following commands to remove/delete the scrub policy, sample_scrub:

  ```python
  from ucsmsdk_samples.server.scrub_policy import scrub_policy_remove

  scrub_policy_remove(handle,name="sample_scrub",parent_dn="org-root")
  ```

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-python-sdk-102/assets/images/ucsm-python-sdk-102-15.png)</br></br>

  The scrub_policy object will be removed from the UCS Manager model (and UCS Manager GUI):

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-python-sdk-102/assets/images/ucsm-python-sdk-102-16.png)</br></br>

This concludes the lab ucsm-python-sdk-102
